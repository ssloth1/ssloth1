### üéì About Me
Former legislative aide turned software engineer. After years as a hobbyist, I took the leap in 2022 and pursued a Master of Science in Computer Science at Northeastern University. My primary interests are in Mobile Application Development, Web Development, and Computer Graphics. 

With graduation fast approaching, I am now seeking a full-time software engineering role!

### üî≠ Current Projects
- Founder of [Pledger](https://pledger.pro), where we aim to provide a platform for secure cryptocurrency donations to non-profits.
- Developing a video effects processor for cameras/video cameras and live streaming.
- Research and developing an algorithm for motion detection on video cameras.

### üåê Development Platforms & Technologies

#### Mobile App Development
I specialize in and greatly enjoy mobile application development. I have built many different applications and even published a simple timer application. Additionally, I served as a TA at Northeastern University and helped roll out the mobile application development course at the Portland campus. In that role, I developed a number of tutorials and demo applications.

#### Web Development
I am highly experienced in JavaScript and working with a MERN stack. Although I am experienced with CSS, I really enjoy using Tailwind CSS. I have built a student dashboard for a local non-profit via the MERN stack, my own personal site, and Pledger.

#### Game Development
This is more of an interest, but I have built some basic games in both Unreal and Unity and am learning about 3D modeling with Blender.
